# Vehicle-Routing-using-Generative-Algorithm
This project uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). It finds efficient routes for vehicles delivering goods to various locations, minimising total distance. The optimal solution is visualised with Matplotlib, showing the locations and routes taken by the vehicles.
